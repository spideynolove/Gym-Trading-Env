## Problem Statement
Analyze the `@sf/` module for its feature engineering capabilities and to identify any potential sources of look-ahead bias, especially in the context of a Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent.

## Success Criteria
A markdown file `sf/SF_ANALYSIS.md` is created, containing a detailed analysis of the feature engineering techniques used in the `sf` module and a critical assessment of look-ahead bias prevention mechanisms. The analysis should provide recommendations for improvement if any issues are found.

## Constraints


## Codebase Context
The user has provided a directory named `sf` which contains a `features` subdirectory, `feeder.py`, and `processors.py`. This module seems to be related to quantitative trading and feature engineering for a trading environment.

**Confidence:** 0.8
**Created:** 2025-11-01T22:56:28.382604

Analyze the `sf/features` directory to understand the feature engineering components. This involves examining each file in the directory to identify the specific feature engineering techniques implemented. The files to be analyzed are: `categorical.py`, `fibonacci.py`, `percentage.py`, `pivot.py`, `price.py`, `rolling.py`, `technical.py`, `time.py`, and `volatility.py`.

**Dependencies:** None

Analyze `sf/feeder.py` and `sf/processors.py` to understand how the generated features are used and to check for any potential look-ahead bias in the data processing pipeline. This will involve examining how data is fed to the feature generation an how the final features are processed before being sent to the RL agent.

Unable to read `sf/processors.py`. I will proceed with the analysis of the other files and create the final report. I will make a note of this in the report.

Write the final analysis to the `sf/SF_ANALYSIS.md` file. The analysis will include a summary of the feature engineering capabilities of the `sf` module, an assessment of the look-ahead bias prevention mechanisms, and recommendations for improvement. I will also note the inability to read `sf/processors.py`.
